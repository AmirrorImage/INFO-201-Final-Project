Info 201 Final Assignment

Project by: Amir Chambers, Leary Labanlic, and Jonathan Dwayne Tammen

Blue Floyd

This project is focused on the incidents of police violence and use of force
 that occured within the United States during the George Floyd (and Breonna Taylor and more) protests in the middle part of 2020.

**We're interested in this field particularly because of the blatant incidents
of racial injustice and police brutality.**

We found 3 data projects involved with police brutality:
 - Data on the total number of records of incidents by police officers of participating (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj).

 - Data from the crowdsourced project at this link (https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality), created to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the
 2020 George Floyd protests. This data is particularly relevant to us not just
 because of the name, but because many of these
 cases have direct video evidence.

 - Data on police shootings in the US since 2015 https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings. The dataset breaks down information specific to different cases in
 the news reports such as: were they fleeing? Were they considered a threat?
 were was it? were the officers wearing a body camera?

 The data-driven questions we hope to answer in this domain are:
  - Was there an increase in police brutality in 2020 vs other years?
  - What is the general outcome of police brutality?
  - Can we predict where and when Police Brutality is & is more likely to occur?

Below is the prompt we are answering:
