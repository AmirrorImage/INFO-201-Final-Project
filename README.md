Info 201 Final Assignment

Project by: Amir Chambers, Leary Labanlic, and Jonathan Dwayne Tammen

The topic that we were interested in is police brutality. With the 2020 protests that were caused by police brutality on minorities we believe it's only right to be looking into the details of every incident to see if there are any patterns. In addition, police brutality is an ongoing issue, so studying and identifying trends is critical for taking appropriate data-drive action.

We found 3 (or more) data projects involved with police brutality:

1. This article (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z) shows multiple data-driven charts that paint the picture of police brutality in the United States. It's a summaraization of a couple of topics that aims to see how police brutality specifically impacts black neighborhoods. 

2. A Medium blogger made a post called "U.S. Police-caused Fatalities" (https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-of-u-s-police-caused-fatalities-fce47a2b7198) that has a number of data science charts. These included charts on race, police caused police, fatalities over time, fatalities by state, poverty, mental health, as well as high school completion rate. 

3. Another Medium blogger post, titled "An Examination of Fatal Force by Police in the US" (https://towardsdatascience.com/an-examination-of-fatal-force-by-police-in-the-us-db897d97085c) has various charts produced using data. Produced charts were on shootings by year, percentage shot by race, a U.S. interactive map pinpointing all fatal shootings, shootings by state, a U.S. heat map of shootings per 100k people, and more. 

 - Data on the total number of records of incidents by police officers of participating (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj).
 - Data from the crowdsourced project at this link (https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality), created to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the 2020 George Floyd protests.

 The data-driven questions we hope to answer in this domain are:
  - Was there an increase in police brutality in 2020 vs other years?
  - What type of people are usually subject to police brutality? 
  - What states have the most police brutality incidents?  
  - What role does mental health play in police fatality? 
  - What is the outlook for polcice fatalities / brutality for the future? 
  - What does the effect of demographic factors (like age, race, income, etc.) look like compared     to the diversity of the police work force?  

Why are you interested in this field/domain?
What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

- We are interested  in this domain because it is an intersect subject of 
that heavily connects to public health and safety.
