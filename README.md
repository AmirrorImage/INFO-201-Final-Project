Info 201 Final Assignment

Project by: Amir Chambers, Leary Labanlic, and Jonathan Dwayne Tammen

The topic that we were interested in is police brutality. With the 2020 protests that were caused by police brutality on minorities we believe it's only right to be looking into the details of every incident to see if there are any patterns. In addition, police brutality is an ongoing issue, so studying and identifying trends is critical for taking appropriate data-drive action.

We found 3 data projects involved with police brutality:

1. This [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z) shows multiple data-driven charts that paint the picture of police brutality in the United States. It's a summaraization of a couple of topics that aims to see how police brutality specifically impacts black neighborhoods. 

2. A Medium blogger made a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-of-u-s-police-caused-fatalities-fce47a2b7198) called "U.S. Police-caused Fatalities"  that has a number of data science charts. These included charts on race, police caused police, fatalities over time, fatalities by state, poverty, mental health, as well as high school completion rate. 

3. Another Medium blogger [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-examination-of-fatal-force-by-police-in-the-us-db897d97085c), titled "An Examination of Fatal Force by Police in the US" has various charts produced using data. Produced charts were on shootings by year, percentage shot by race, a U.S. interactive map pinpointing all fatal shootings, shootings by state, a U.S. heat map of shootings per 100k people, and more. 

The data-driven questions we hope to answer in this domain are:
  - Was there an increase in police brutality in 2020 vs other years?
  - What type of people are usually subject to police brutality? 
  - What states have the most police brutality incidents?  
  - What role does mental health play in police fatality? 
  - What is the outlook for polcice fatalities / brutality for the future? 
  - What does the effect of demographic factors (like age, race, income, etc.) look like compared to the diversity of the police work force?  

To help answer these data-driven questions, we found 3 datasets:

1. [Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj) on the total number of records of incidents by police officers.
  - We downloaded this dataset from the Seattle governments official website.
  - The City of Seattle collected this data which are records representing use of force by law enforcement officers of the Seattle Police Department.
  - 12,087 observations (rows)
  - 11 features (columns)
  - This helps answer the questions about whether or not an increase of police brutality took place in 2020 vs other years.
Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
How many observations (rows) are in your data?
How many features (columns) are in the data?
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

2. [Data](https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality) from a crowdsourced project, created to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the 2020 George Floyd protests.
  - We downloaded the data from a github repository.
  - This data was collected from a crowdsourced project in which they recieved reports or found news links that tied together the incident.
  - 1933 observations (rows)
  - 4 features (columns)
  - This data helps answer the question on which state had the most police brutality incidents.
